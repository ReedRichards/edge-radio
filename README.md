# EDGE.CA to Spotify

old project of mine, no longer use.

The idea behind this is that it would scrape edge.ca's currently playing song, and if that song was not already in the playlist, it would add it to the playlist, and email me a notification.  Its sloppy, poorly written, and one of my first real projects. I am extremely proud of it because it was the first time I had ever solved a real problem programming.
